  - Infrastructure: Google Cloud Run

#### Step 2: Create Architecture Spec
```bash
gemini create-spec "Multi-tenant database architecture with row-level security and tenant isolation"
```

#### Step 3: Implement Core Infrastructure
```bash
gemini execute-tasks "Set up multi-tenant database schema with tenant isolation and implement core authentication system"
```

#### Advanced Workflow Commands:
```bash
# Create document management feature
gemini create-spec "Secure document upload, storage, and sharing system with version control and audit trails"

# Implement client portal
gemini create-spec "Client portal with secure document access, e-signatures, and communication features"

# Add compliance module

2. **API Architecture**: RESTful APIs with tenant context
3. **Security Layer**: JWT tokens, row-level security, encryption
4. **File Management**: Secure upload/download with GCS
5. **Deployment Config**: Docker, Cloud Run configurations
6. **Testing Suite**: Integration tests for multi-tenancy

### Example 3: Multi-Agent Salon Customer Support

**Concept**: Build an AI-powered customer support system with multiple specialized agents for salon businesses.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Multi-Agent System
```bash
gemini plan-product "AI-powered multi-agent customer support system for salons with booking, FAQ, service recommendations, and complaint handling agents"
```

Configuration:
- **Target Users**: Salon owners, spa businesses
- **Agent Types**:
  - Booking Agent: Handle appointments
  - FAQ Agent: Answer common questions
  - Recommendation Agent: Suggest services
  - Complaint Handler: Manage issues
  - Supervisor Agent: Route and escalate
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Framework: Python FastAPI
  - AI/ML: Google Vertex AI, Gemini API
  - Database: Firestore
  - Message Queue: Google Pub/Sub
  - Frontend: React with Material-UI

#### Step 2: Design Agent Architecture
```bash
gemini create-spec "Multi-agent architecture with supervisor agent for routing and specialized agents for different support tasks"
```

#### Step 3: Implement Core Agent System
```bash
gemini execute-tasks "Create base agent framework with message routing and implement booking agent with calendar integration"
```

#### Progressive Implementation:
```bash
# Add FAQ agent
gemini create-spec "FAQ agent with knowledge base integration and learning capabilities"
gemini execute-tasks "Implement FAQ agent with Vertex AI search integration"

# Add recommendation engine
gemini create-spec "Service recommendation agent using customer history and preferences"
gemini execute-tasks "Build recommendation agent with ML model integration"

# Implement supervisor logic
gemini create-spec "Supervisor agent with intelligent routing, escalation, and performance monitoring"
gemini execute-tasks "Create supervisor agent with routing rules and analytics"
```

#### Agent Communication Flow:
```
Customer Message → Supervisor Agent
                        ↓
                  [Route Decision]
                   ↙    ↓    ↘
            Booking  FAQ  Recommendation
             Agent   Agent    Agent
                   ↘    ↓    ↙
                  Response Builder
                        ↓
                 Customer Response
```

#### CS-AgentOS Generated Architecture:

   - Configure model preferences in `.agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`

2. **Complex Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - Break down into smaller specs
   - Implement one agent at a time
   - Use supervisor pattern for coordination

3. **Google Cloud Integration**
   - Ensure proper API keys are configured
   - Use CS-AgentOS cloud-native agent for configs
   - Follow generated security best practices

## Conclusion

CS-AgentOS with Gemini CLI provides a powerful combination for building sophisticated applications with Google Cloud integrations. The structured approach ensures consistent quality while the specialized agents handle complex tasks efficiently.
